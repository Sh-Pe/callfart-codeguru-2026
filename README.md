# callfart-codeguru-2026
GitHub Repository for non-essential components for the second place in CodeGuru competition of 2026, CallFart from GSA, (Shahar Perets and Tal Akler). 

The python code is really shitty, MFABT kinda thing. Works only on linux. A lot of repetative code. Hard-coded values like paths. 

Commit authorized by me (Shahar Perets) because Tal has a skill issue with Git
